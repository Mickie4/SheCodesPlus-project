## Description ##
Weather web application it allows the user to get a current weather result plus forecast of the next 18 hrs; this can be achived by using geolocation,
or by typing into the search bar the name of the city they want.&nbsp;  

## Technologies ##
I created this app with [Bootstrap's](https://getbootstrap.com//) grid system and layout utilities, custom CSS, HTML and Vanilla JavaScript.&nbsp;  
To make the AJAX requests I used axios and for the real time weather information [The Open Weather Map's API](https://openweathermap.org//).


## UX ##

The website was regularly tested with Chrome Devtools to assure responsiveness across all viewports.
